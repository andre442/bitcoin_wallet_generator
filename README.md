# bitcoin_wallet_generator
The safest cold storage method to keep your Bitcoins ;)

This is a simple script to generate a key pair (public and private) on the bitcoin network. In the 'dist' folder there is also an .exe file to generate the keys. At each run, new keys will be appended to the generated '.txt' file and also new images will be generated with a pair of qrcodes in '.png' format.

And never forget, always keep your keys safe.
