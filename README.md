# bitcoin_wallet_generator
The best cold storage method to keep your Bitcoins safe ;)

-This is a simple script to generate a valid key pair (public and private) on the bitcoin network. 

-In the 'dist' folder there is also an .exe file to generate the keys (in case you don't have python installed on your computer).

-At each run, new keys will be appended to the '.txt' file and also new images will be generated with a pair of qrcodes in '.png' format.

And never forget, ALWAYS keep your keys safe.
