# Bitcoin Wallet Generator
The best cold storage method to keep your Bitcoins safe ;)

-This is a simple script to generate a valid key pair (public and private) on the bitcoin network. To minimize risks, it is recommended to use this code on a computer disconnected from the internet and after creating the keys, print it on paper and keep it in a safe place. If you don't really know what you're doing... read more about this topic so you don't mess up: https://blockgeeks.com/guides/paper-wallet-guide/

-In the 'dist' folder there is also an .exe file to generate the keys (in case you don't have python installed on your computer).

-At each run, new keys will be appended to the '.txt' file and also new images will be generated with a pair of qrcodes in '.png' format.

-You can also generate your paper wallet from the link below. Bitadress is one of the most famous places to create keys, but beware of fake sites. It is also recommended when creating the keys to temporarily turn off your internet connection.

And never forget, ALWAYS keep your keys safe.
